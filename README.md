# M8-Assess

Using data taken from https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/abs.2019.html, in this repository we look at some technological characteristics of businesses across the US in order to find out how new technological innovations such as artificial intelligence, cloud-based computing and robotics among other things are related to companies' performance and statistics in a positive, negative, or sometimes netural way if at all, and what prevented companies from utilizing these technologies if they weren't adopted.

Each file has more detailed ETL information regarding specifics on what was done with the data obtained from the census APIs and what was needed for the graphs and tables in that notebook, and seaborn and matplotlib were used throughout these files. As such, each file should be ran on its own and are not interdependent on one another, with the only thing being absolutely needed for them to work being the API key labeled predicates['key'] = 'key_here_in_actual_code' # DON'T CHANGE THIS in most files and some various python packages that are listed as imports in each jupyter notebook.

A sample dataset merge can be found at the bottom of M8-Assess-Grp8-YAN.ipynb.

For group 6 with members Charlie Rehder, Jared Mindel, Mikhaela Anderson, Yansong Tang.

Our final analysis is in the "Census Data Analysis.ipynb" file.
