# M8-Assess


Each file has more detailed ETL information regarding specifics on what was needed for the graphs in that notebook, and seaborn and matplotlib were used throughout these files. As such, each file should be ran on its own and are not interdependent on one another, with the only thing needed for them to work being the API key labeled predicates['key'] = '7c2c8ae1aefce7823680175cfa25d0ba300fe6f5' # DON'T CHANGE THIS in most files and some various python packages that are listed as imports in each jupyter notebook

A sample dataset merge can be found at the bottom of M8-Assess-Grp8-YAN.ipynb
